# chip-8-emulator
A CHIP-8 Interpreter written with C/C++, using SDL2/OpenGL3 for graphics and rendering, and Dear ImGui for the user interface. The interpreter also contains a disassembler which translates the program into pseudo-assembly instructions and displays them for debugging purposes.  Currently a work in progress, it passes most tests in [Chip-8 Test Suite](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite). I created this as an entryway into learning emulator development.

To-do's:
*Upload remaining dependency files (includes, libs, etc)
*File organization
*Screenshots/Demo
